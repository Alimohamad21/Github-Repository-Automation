# Github-Repository-Automation
• Created a bot which automatically uploads my projects to GitHub.
• The app lets you choose between two modes, new project and existing project.
• It then opens the File Explorer to let you choose the project's directory.
• If it's a new project, it asks you for the repository name desired, then it goes to github.com ,logs in to your account, creates a new repository 
, and automates the command window instructions necessary for pushing your project to GitHub, and finally opens the new repository on Github.com.
• If it's an existing project, it asks you for a short description of your update (for the name of the commit) , and automates the command window instructions necessary to update your existing project, and finally opens the updated repository on Github.com.
• The app was developed in python using selenium package.
